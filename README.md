Delighted to share my SQL project analysis approach! 
Here are the key steps I follow to derive actionable insights and drive data-informed decisions based on Sales Retail Dataset between 2017 and 2019
1) understanding data and make some editing like unpivoting some columns through power query in excel
2) SSIS package transfers data from CSV files to database, streamlining extraction, transformation, and loading for efficient data integration and finally making relationships betweens tables in database
3)Data Exploration: Dive deep into the data, unraveling patterns, trends, and outliers. Understanding the data's nuances lays the foundation for meaningful analysis.
4)Data Transformation: Transform raw data into a usable format. This step involves cleaning, aggregating, and structuring data, ensuring it's primed for in-depth analysis.
5)SQL Code Analysis: Carefully crafted SQL queries are pivotal. I dissect and optimize SQL code, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. This step is where the magic happens, translating raw data into valuable information,Answer the following Questions:
-Which store type has a maximum total sale?
-Which store location has a maximum total sale?
-Which category has a maximum total sales and profit?
-Which subcategory has a maximum total sales and profit?
-Over last three years compare between them in terms of total sales and profit
-Quiring comparison between months over every year in terms of total sales and profit
-Quering comparison between storetypes with location over last year in terms of total sales 
 and targetsales setting an indicator column
-what is the next and past profit amount of all subcategories in clothing category? 
-Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the Wages vary a lot?
